Here is what I've learned about the GitBook Processâ€¦

The Summery file is what controls the hierarchy of the whole book.

You Cannot change the name of the summery. If you do, the rest of the code will not work.

The sections of the book are defined here in the summery file in list format. Do not put any spaces between the lists - this causes a bug and the local server will fail.
